# Week 4 Project for Epicodus Javascript
This project has been about self exploration and identifying areas that we need to improve in.

## What did I do?

I decided to spend the day beginning to work towards and AWS (Amazon Web Service) certification.  Through my initial research (and a very helpful talk given to us at Epicodus) I decided that the best guide for learning AWS would be [acloud.guru](https://acloud.guru/).  So I signed up for a free 7 day trial and began following the coursework.  

## What do I have to show for it?

I never thought you'd ask!  

I decided the best way to record my progress was to capture screenshots. Since screenshots are automatically titled with the date and the time so you can see that I spent all day working on this. I progressed through most of the course intended to prepare you for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner test and was able to get through most of the content.

The first main topic was covering the AWS S3 (simple storage solution) service. This is an unlimited object storage service that can handle file sizes of up to several terabytes! It can also be use, somewhat like gh-pages, to host static websites.  The course had a demo index.html page that it had me deploy, but I then went and deployed our intro-to-programming group project.  You can go check it out, live on the internet [here](http://epicodus-projects-aaron-ross.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/).

The remainder of what I was able to get through in the allotted time dealt with the EC2 services for virtual servers and using the AWS relational database service.  I learned the basics of how to use both of these services including how to create different database platforms (i.e. MySQL, PostgreSQL, and amazon's Aurora), using elastic load balancers, setting security groups, and running auto scaling groups to automatically spin up servers (correctly set up using and image of the first server) to handle on demand traffic or server failure.  This led to being able to publish, again live and in the wild, a basic wordpress blog which can be seen at the following URL http://my-alb-1788813427.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/
